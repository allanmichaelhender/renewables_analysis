Welcome to my analysis on Renewable Energy in the UK and a delve into 5 companies with their associated stocks.

The data comes from two sources:
yahoo finance for the stocks data
UK.gov for the renewables data: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-trends-section-6-renewables
- In particular the Renewable electricity capacity and generation spreadsheet

Within the Renewables_Data folder is the data from UK.gov, reformatted into csv files for analysis

There are two Jupyter notebook files:
1. stocks analysis
2. renewable energy generation

stocks analysis:
Within this notebook we load in the stocks data from yahoo finance and analyse the data

renewable energy generation:
Using the aformentioned data, we clean and export the data for later use.

The Exported_Data folder contains data exported from our notebook.

Reports and Analysis:
1. Investing in Renewables - Report PDF
2. Data plots - POWER BI PDF

Within these PDF's we explore the data and draw conclusions.
